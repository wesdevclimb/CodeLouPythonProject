My basic Django CRUD application****

This web service is serves a very basic CRUD function for logging foods into a food diary.
It's not very flashy but I included Bootstrap so it is still responsive to different screen sizes.

Directions to run****

Clone the repo on your local machine, navigate to the manage.py and pip install Django. 
Then fire up the a local server with manage.py runserver [any open port]

Point your browser at that port and the my project should be up and running.
